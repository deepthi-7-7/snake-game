# Snake Game

This Snake Game is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a snake on a grid-based screen and aims to eat apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries or its own body.

## Features

- Player-controlled snake movement using arrow keys
- Collision detection for boundaries and self-collision
- Randomly generated apples for the snake to eat
- Snake growth upon consuming an apple
- Score tracking based on the length of the snake's body

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/deepthi-7-7/snake-game.git
