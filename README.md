# Snake Game

This Snake Game is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a snake on a grid-based screen and aims to eat apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries or its own body.

## Features

- Player-controlled snake movement using arrow keys
- Collision detection for boundaries and self-collision
- Randomly generated apples for the snake to eat
- Snake growth upon consuming an apple
- Score tracking based on the length of the snake's body

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/deepthi-7-7/snake-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd snake-game
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Usage

Run the game using the following command:

```
python snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides and restarts automatically.

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement different levels of difficulty
- Include high score tracking and leaderboard functionality

## Acknowledgements

- The Snake Game was developed using the Pygame library, which provides an easy-to-use framework for building 2D games in Python.
